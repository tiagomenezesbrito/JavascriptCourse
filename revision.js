/* 
3 ways to create variables: 

-> var
-> const: Used to create constant variables. They can't be re-assigned and you can't declare them without assigning a value.
-> let: Creates a variable that can be re-assigned anytime on the code and also, you can declare the variable and assign the value later.
-> Const creates a variable that is constant and can't be re-assigned or changed later in the code. You usually create them at the top of your code.
