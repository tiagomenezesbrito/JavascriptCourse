/* 
DOM REVISION

main goal with js:
-> Select elements on the document
-> Apply Some changes


the main ways we can select elements on the DOM are:

-> getElementById 
-> getElementByClass
-> getElementByTagName this don't allow the use with any array method, you need to transform using spread operator [...]

-> querySelector()
-> querySelectorAll() this one allow the forEach, but to use the other methods need [...]



Navigate the DOM
-Sometimes, you can't use the other ways to select the elements, so you need to navigate the DOM.

Here are the main ways:

-childnodes (this one is kinda bad)

-children
-firstChild
-LastChild

-parentElement
these 2 return white spaces, so you need to be careful
-previousSibling
-nextSibling

-previousElementSibling
-nextElementSibling
